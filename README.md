# Quick start
This project is for quick dive into different programming languages with one simple and representative task.

## Task definition
Each program solve the same problem - case insensitive counting of words from input text and sorting them by counts in descend order.

For example each program produce text `To be, or not to be?` as input and write result to standart output:
```
Words count in sentence: "To be, or not to be?"
to 2
be 2
or 1
not 1
```
