# Quick start
This project is for quick dive into different programming languages with one simple and representative task.

## Task definition
Each program solve the same problem - counting symbols in input text with the except of spaces and sort them by counts in descend order.

For example each program produce text `Hello world!` as input and write result to standart output:
```
Symbols count in sequence: Hello world!
l 3
o 2
w 1
r 1
e 1
d 1
H 1
! 1
```
